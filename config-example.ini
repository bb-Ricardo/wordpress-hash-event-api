### Welcome to the wordpress-hash-event-api configuration file.

# The values in this file override the default values used by the system if
# a config option is not specified. The commented out lines are the configuration
# field and the default value used. Uncommenting a line and changing the value
# will change the value used at runtime when the process is restarted.

# All values can be overwritten by environment variables.
# The schema:
#   SECTION_VAR_NAME=VALUE
#
# concatenate section name and var name with an underscore.
# environment vars are read case insensitive.
# example:
#   DATABASE_PASSWORD=Sup3rS3cur31!11!
